# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct to foster an open and welcoming community.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing courtesy and professionalism

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment, doxxing, or publishing others’ private information
- Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at:

- community@krawl.app (general conduct)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines
