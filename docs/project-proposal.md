## 1. 🎯 Overview

**The Living Map of Filipino Culture**

**Krawl** is a community-driven Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to map and share authentic, hyperlocal Filipino culture. Moving beyond generic listings, Krawl empowers users ("**Locals**") to pin points of interest ("**Gems**") – from hidden food stalls and street art to historical markers – and weave them into curated, step-by-step trails ("**Krawls**").

Its unique "**Krawl Mode**" offers a guided, location-aware experience, turning discovery into an interactive adventure led by local insights.

> **Mission:** To be the go-to platform for discovering the Philippines' rich cultural tapestry, one Krawl at a time, starting with key hubs like Cebu or Metro Manila.

---

## 2. ❌ Problem Statement

While the Philippines boasts incredible cultural diversity, discovering authentic, hyperlocal experiences remains fragmented and challenging. Existing tools fall short:

### 🗺️ General Map Apps (e.g., Google Maps)
- Overwhelmed with commercial listings
- Lack curated paths
- Struggle to surface truly unique, non-mainstream spots ("signal vs. noise")
- Reviews lack local context and structure for guided exploration

### 📱 Social Media (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, Facebook Groups)
- Offer inspiration (#HiddenGemsPH) but lack practical navigation
- Missing structured information
- No reliable offline capability
- Inconsistent quality control
- Discovery is passive and disorganized ("inspiration without a plan")

### 📖 Travel Blogs/Guides
- Often cater primarily to tourists
- Become outdated quickly
- Lack real-time, granular detail
- Missing community validation of a constantly updated local map

### 💡 The Gap

**There is no dedicated platform that effectively combines community-sourced local knowledge with structured, navigable experiences**, leading to missed opportunities for both locals seeking deeper connection with their surroundings and travelers craving genuine cultural immersion.

---

## 3. ✨ Solution: Krawl

Krawl addresses this gap by providing a platform centered around community curation and guided experiences, delivered via an accessible PWA:

### 📍 Community-Driven Mapping ("Gems")
Locals pin and describe places they know and love, creating a rich database prioritizing authenticity over commercial volume. A community vouching and rating system ensures quality emerges organically. Gems appear instantly in a 'pending' state, visible to all.

### 🚶 Curated Trails ("Krawls")
Users connect Gems into themed, ordered trails (food crawls, history walks, art tours), adding personal notes and "**Lokal Secrets**" for each stop. This provides structure, narrative, and invaluable insider context.

### 🧭 Interactive "Krawl Mode" *(Core Differentiator)*
Users follow a Krawl step-by-step, receiving location-triggered guidance, creator notes, and photos directly within the app, turning discovery into an immersive, guided adventure ("plan with inspiration").

### ✅ Community Quality Control
Built-in systems for vouching (verification), rating (quality), flagging outdated/closed spots (lifecycleStatus), and creator reputation ensure data remains fresh and trustworthy without relying solely on administrators.

### 📴 Offline Functionality
Downloadable Krawls (including map tiles and notes) ensure the guided experience works reliably even in areas with inconsistent connectivity, critical for the Philippine context.

### 💼 Freemium for Businesses
A non-intrusive revenue model allows local businesses to "claim" their Gem (which remains free on the map) to provide verified info (hours, menu) and real-time updates ("**Lokal Updates**"), enhancing data quality for users without compromising the community vibe or user experience.
