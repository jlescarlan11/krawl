## 3. Brand Story

> **The Problem**

Tired of sifting through commercial noise on generic maps and fragmented inspiration on social media?

> **The Insight**

Krawl was born from the desire to find the **real Philippines** – the hidden lugawan, the vibrant street art down an alley, the historical marker everyone walks past.

> **Our Belief**

**We believe the best guide to a place is the people who live there.**

> **The Solution**

Krawl is a platform built by locals, for everyone, turning shared knowledge into discoverable "**Gems**" and curated "**Krawls**." 

It's more than just a map; it's an invitation to explore your community's unique story, guided by the people who know it best.

Passive Discovery          →    Active Adventure
├─ Static map pins        →    Step-by-step guidance
├─ Generic listings       →    Location-aware experiences
├─ No context            →    Insider notes & secrets
└─ Online-only           →    Offline-ready
```

> **It's an interactive adventure, not just a list of pins.**

Not This                    But This

| ❌ What We Don't Do | ✅ What We Do |
|---------------------|---------------|
