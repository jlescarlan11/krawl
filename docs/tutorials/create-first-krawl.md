### Story: The Krawl You'll Create

You're creating a **"Foodie's Night Out in Quezon City"** Krawl—a 3-hour food crawl hitting the best street food spots near UP Diliman.

**Route:**
1. **Aling Nena's Isaw** (appetizer)
2. **Rodic's Tapsilog** (main course)
3. **Mang Larry's Halo-Halo** (dessert)

## Step 1: What is a Krawl?

### Definition

A **Krawl** is a curated trail connecting multiple Gems in a specific order, designed to guide users through a unique experience.

### Types of Krawls

- 🍜 **Food Crawls** - Restaurant/street food tours
- 🎨 **Art Crawls** - Museums, galleries, street art
- 🏛️ **Historical Trails** - Heritage sites and landmarks
- 🌳 **Nature Walks** - Parks, gardens, scenic spots
- 🏃 **Fitness Routes** - Running/cycling paths with rest stops

### What Makes a Great Krawl?

✅ **Focused Theme** - Clear concept (e.g., "Best Coffee Shops")  
✅ **Logical Order** - Makes sense geographically or narratively  
✅ **Right Length** - 3-8 stops (not too short, not overwhelming)  
✅ **Helpful Notes** - Context, tips, and insider secrets  
✅ **Quality Gems** - Verified, highly-vouched locations  

---

## Step 2: Navigate to My Krawls

### Access Your Krawls

1. From the map view, click **"My Krawls"** tab in the bottom navigation
2. You'll see your Krawls Dashboard with:
   - **Created Krawls** (empty for now)
   - **Saved Krawls** (bookmarked from others)
   - **Recent Activity** (ratings received, etc.)

### Start Creating

1. Click the **"+ Create New Krawl"** button
2. The **Krawl Builder** interface opens

---

## Step 3: Set Up Your Krawl

### Enter Basic Information

**Title** (Required):
```
Foodie's Night Out in Quezon City
```

**Description** (Required, 100-500 characters):
```
A delicious 3-hour food crawl hitting the best street food spots near UP Diliman. Perfect for students, tourists, and anyone craving authentic Filipino flavors. Budget-friendly and walking-friendly route!
```

**Visibility** (Choose one):
- ✅ **Public** - Anyone can see and follow
- ⚪ **Friends Only** - Only your connections (coming soon)
- ⚪ **Private** - Only you (coming soon)

Select **Public** for this tutorial.

**Tags** (Optional):
- Add: `Food`, `Street Food`, `Walking Tour`, `Budget-Friendly`

✅ **Checkpoint:** Basic info complete!

---

## Step 4: Add Your First Stop

### Open the Gem Selector

1. In the Krawl Builder, click **"+ Add Stop"**
2. The **"Select Gem"** modal opens with three tabs:
   - **My Gems** - Gems you created
   - **Saved** - Gems you've bookmarked
   - **Search Map** - Find any Gem

### Choose Your First Gem

1. Go to **"My Gems"** tab
2. Find **"Aling Nena's Isaw Stand"**
3. Click **"Add as Stop 1"**

**Alternative: Search for a Gem**
1. Switch to **"Search Map"** tab
2. Type the Gem name in the search box
3. Select from results

### Add Context with Creator Notes

Now that the Gem is added, customize this stop:

**Creator Note:**
```
Start your food journey here! Order the classic isaw (3 sticks for ₱15). Ask Aling Nena about the "special sauce"—it's a secret blend that makes this spot legendary.
```

**Lokal Secret** (optional):
```
If you come on Friday nights, Aling Nena sometimes has fresh squid balls (not on the regular menu). They run out fast!
```

**Pro tip for Lokal Secrets:**
- Insider tips only locals know
- Best time to visit
- Hidden menu items
- How to get discounts
- Who to ask for

✅ **Checkpoint:** First stop added with notes!

---

## Step 5: Add More Stops

### Add Stop 2: Rodic's Tapsilog

1. Click **"+ Add Stop"** again
2. Search for **"Rodic's Tapsilog"** (or create it if it doesn't exist)
3. Click **"Add as Stop 2"**

**Creator Note:**
```
The main event! Rodic's is a UP Diliman institution. Order the "Rodic's Special" (tapsilog with extra rice). Expect a 10-15 minute wait during peak hours (7-9 PM), but it's worth it.
```

**Lokal Secret:**
```
Sit at the counter facing the kitchen if you want to watch the cooks in action. It's also where regulars sit, and you might overhear some campus gossip!
```

### Add Stop 3: Mang Larry's Halo-Halo

1. Click **"+ Add Stop"**
2. Search for **"Mang Larry's Halo-Halo"**
3. Click **"Add as Stop 3"**

**Creator Note:**
```
End your night with the best halo-halo in the area! Mang Larry's version is perfectly layered with leche flan, ube, and generous shaved ice. Share one—they're huge!
```

**Lokal Secret:**
```
Request extra leche flan for just ₱10 more. Mang Larry is usually there on weekends and loves chatting about the neighborhood's history.
```

✅ **Checkpoint:** All 3 stops added!

---

## Step 6: Reorder Your Stops

### Check the Route

The Krawl Builder shows:
- Your stops in order (1 → 2 → 3)
- A route line connecting them on the map
- Estimated distance between stops

### Reorder if Needed

**Drag and drop:**
1. Click and hold the **"☰"** drag handle on any stop
2. Drag it up or down to reorder
3. Release to set new position

**Why order matters:**
- Logical flow (appetizer → main → dessert)
- Geographic efficiency (minimize backtracking)
- Timing (some places only open at certain hours)

✅ **Checkpoint:** Stops are in the perfect order!

## Best Practices for Creating Krawls

### Theme & Structure

✅ **Do:**
- Choose a clear, focused theme
- Keep it to 3-8 stops (sweet spot: 4-6)
- Order stops logically (geography or narrative)
- Estimate realistic time (include travel + visit time)

❌ **Don't:**
- Mix unrelated themes (food + museums + shopping)
- Create overly long Krawls (10+ stops)
- Plan impossible routes (stops 10km apart)

### Writing Creator Notes

✅ **Do:**
- Be personal and conversational
- Share specific tips ("Order the #3 combo")
- Mention timing ("Come before 6 PM to avoid crowds")
- Include pricing if known ("Budget ₱200 total")

❌ **Don't:**
- Copy from websites (write original content)
- Write generic notes ("This place is nice")
- Include outdated info (verify before publishing)

### Lokal Secrets

✅ **Do:**
- Share genuine insider tips
- Reveal hidden menu items or tricks
- Mention the best time to visit
- Tell personal anecdotes

❌ **Don't:**
- Reveal private or sensitive info
- Share trade secrets that could harm businesses
- Make up fake "secrets"

### Quality Over Quantity

Better to have **1 great Krawl** than **10 mediocre ones**. Focus on:
- Personal experience (visit all stops yourself)
- Verified information (check hours, locations)
- Helpful details (parking, accessibility, etc.)
- Regular updates (edit if something changes)
