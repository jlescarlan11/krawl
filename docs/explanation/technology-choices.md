## üìã Quick Summary

| Category | Technology | Key Reason |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16 + React 19 | PWA support, server-side rendering, rapid development |
| **Backend** | Spring Boot 3.5.7 | Robust, scalable REST API framework |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15 + PostGIS 3.3 | Geospatial queries essential for location-based features |
| **Maps** | MapLibre GL JS + MapTiler | Modern WebGL rendering, 3D support, offline capability |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 | Rapid UI development, utility-first approach |
| **Offline** | IndexedDB (idb) | Structured storage for offline-first architecture |

## üéØ Core Principles

Our technology choices were guided by these principles:

1. **Offline-First**: All technologies must support offline functionality
2. **Cost-Effective**: Leverage free/low-cost tiers for MVP
3. **Rapid Development**: Modern frameworks that accelerate development
4. **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested technologies, not experimental
5. **Scalability**: Easy to scale horizontally as usage grows
6. **Developer Experience**: Tools that make development enjoyable and efficient

## üîë Key Decisions

### Frontend: Next.js

**Why?**
- Built-in PWA support via service workers
- Excellent SEO and performance out of the box
- App Router provides modern patterns
- Strong TypeScript support
- Great developer experience

**Alternative Considered:** Vanilla React + React Router  
**Decision:** Next.js wins for PWA features and deployment simplicity

---

### Backend: Spring Boot

**Why?**
- Mature, production-tested framework
- Excellent database integration (JPA/Hibernate)
- Built-in security (Spring Security)
- Large ecosystem and community
- Easy deployment options

**Alternative Considered:** Node.js/Express, Django  
**Decision:** Spring Boot chosen for robustness and geospatial query integration

---

### Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS

**Why?**
- PostGIS is the industry standard for geospatial data
- Native support for geography types and spatial queries
- Efficient proximity searches (`ST_DWithin`, `ST_Distance`)
- Battle-tested for production workloads
- Free and open-source

**Alternative Considered:** MongoDB with geospatial indexes  
**Decision:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS chosen for superior geospatial capabilities

---

### Maps: MapLibre GL JS + MapTiler

**Why?**
- WebGL-based rendering for smooth performance
- Native 3D building support (critical for our design)
- Vector tiles = smaller file sizes + smooth zooming
- Full offline capability via service worker caching
- Open-source (no vendor lock-in)
- Excellent mobile performance

**Alternative Considered:** Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap  
**Decision:** MapLibre GL JS chosen for 3D capabilities and modern WebGL rendering

---

### Styling: Tailwind CSS v4

**Why?**
- Utility-first approach = rapid UI development
- Seamless integration with our design system
- Small bundle size (tree-shaking)
- Excellent developer experience
- Direct implementation of "Lokal Verde" design tokens

**Alternative Considered:** CSS Modules, Styled Components  
**Decision:** Tailwind chosen for speed and design system integration

---

### Offline Storage: IndexedDB (via idb)

**Why?**
- Large storage capacity (~50MB+)
- Structured database with indexes
- Asynchronous API (no UI blocking)
- Better than localStorage for complex data
- Full CRUD operations

**Alternative Considered:** localStorage, SessionStorage  
**Decision:** IndexedDB chosen for structured offline data storage

---

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

We prioritize **free/low-cost tiers** for MVP:

- **Frontend:** Vercel (free tier: generous bandwidth)
- **Backend:** Render (free tier: suitable for MVP)
- **Database:** Render PostgreSQL or Supabase (both offer free tiers)
- **Images:** Cloudinary (25GB free storage + bandwidth)
- **Maps:** MapTiler (100,000 free tile loads/month)

**Philosophy:** Start free, pay as you grow. Easy upgrade paths without architecture changes.

## üìä Trade-offs

### What We Prioritized
- ‚úÖ **Developer Velocity** ‚Üí Modern frameworks
- ‚úÖ **Offline Support** ‚Üí PWA-first architecture
- ‚úÖ **Cost Efficiency** ‚Üí Free-tier deployments
- ‚úÖ **Geospatial Performance** ‚Üí PostGIS native queries

### What We Deferred
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Real-time features (WebSockets) ‚Üí Future enhancement
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Advanced caching (Redis) ‚Üí Can add later if needed
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Microservices architecture ‚Üí Monolith is fine for MVP
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Kubernetes ‚Üí Simple deployments sufficient

---

## üîÆ Future Considerations

As the project grows, we may consider:

1. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket support for live updates
2. **Advanced Caching**: Redis for API response caching
3. **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for full-text search
4. **CDN Expansion**: Multi-region deployment
5. **Microservices**: Split by domain (auth, gems, krawls)
6. **Database Sharding**: Geographic sharding if needed

**Philosophy:** Optimize for current needs, refactor when necessary.
