# 🗺️ Project Brief: Krawl

## 1. Overview

**Krawl** is a community-driven Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to map authentic, hyperlocal Filipino culture. Users pin local spots ("**Gems**") and create guided trails ("**Krawls**") with insider notes. The core feature, "**Krawl Mode**," offers an interactive, location-aware experience for following these trails, complete with offline functionality.

Krawl aims to be the go-to platform for discovering genuine Filipino experiences, powered by local knowledge, launching initially in key hubs (e.g., Cebu/Metro Manila).

---

## 2. Problem

Discovering authentic, hyperlocal Filipino culture is difficult:

- 🗺️ **Map apps** are noisy with commercial listings
- 📱 **Social media** lacks structure and navigation
- 📖 **Travel guides** are often outdated or tourist-focused

**There's no single platform combining community-sourced knowledge with guided, navigable experiences.**

---

## 3. Solution

Krawl provides a PWA where locals share **Gems** and build **Krawls**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Krawl Mode** | Guides users step-by-step with contextual notes |
| **Community Quality** | Vouching, ratings, and flagging ensure quality and freshness |
| **Offline First** | Downloadable Krawls ensure usability anywhere |
| **Freemium Model** | Businesses can claim Gems for verified info/updates |
