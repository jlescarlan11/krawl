## Proximity Search

### Find Gems Near a Location

```sql
-- Find Gems within 5km of a point
SELECT 
    gem_id, 
    name, 
    description,
    ST_Distance(location, ST_MakePoint(121.0244, 14.5547)::geography) as distance_meters
FROM gems
WHERE ST_DWithin(
    location, 
    ST_MakePoint(121.0244, 14.5547)::geography,  -- Manila coordinates
    5000  -- 5km radius in meters
)
AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY distance_meters
LIMIT 20;
```

**Parameters:**
- `121.0244, 14.5547` - Longitude, Latitude (Manila)
- `5000` - Radius in meters

WHERE gr.status = 'pending'
GROUP BY g.gem_id
HAVING COUNT(gr.report_id) >= 3
ORDER BY report_count DESC;
```

## Performance Tips

### Use Indexes

All queries leverage these indexes:
- `idx_gems_location` (GIST) - proximity searches
- `idx_gems_founder_id` - user content queries
- `idx_krawls_creator_id` - user krawls
- `idx_gem_ratings_gem_id` - rating aggregations

### Optimize Queries

- **Use `LIMIT`** for pagination
- **Add `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`** to filter soft-deleted records
- **Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`** to check query plans
- **Consider materialized views** for complex dashboards
