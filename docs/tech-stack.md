## üé® Frontend Stack

### **Next.js** (React Framework)

**Rationale:**
- Enables rapid development of a performant, server-rendered/statically-generated PWA
- Supports features crucial for SEO and PWA functionality (like service workers for offline support)
- Aligns with potential team familiarity with React/JavaScript
- Built-in optimization for production deployments

**Language:** JavaScript/TypeScript

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Stack

### **Spring Boot** (Java/Kotlin)

**Rationale:**
- Provides a robust, mature, and scalable framework for building the REST API
- Offers strong database integration and security features
- Large ecosystem with extensive community support
- Kotlin is a viable, modern language option within this framework

**Language:** Java or Kotlin

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database

### **PostgreSQL** with **PostGIS Extension**

**Rationale:**
- Powerful open-source relational database
- **PostGIS** provides essential, high-performance geospatial data types and functions
- Required for storing Gem locations and performing proximity queries
- Supports duplicate checks and nearby searches efficiently
- Battle-tested for production workloads

---

## üé® Styling Framework

### **Tailwind CSS v4**

**Rationale:**
- Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- Easy implementation of the "Lokal Verde" design system directly within markup
- Minimal CSS bundle size with tree-shaking
- Excellent developer experience with modern tooling

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Mapping Library

### **Leaflet.js**

**With Potential Plugins:**
- `Leaflet.markercluster` - For handling Gem density visualization

**Rationale:**
- Lightweight, flexible, open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps
- Well-suited for PWA implementation
- Excellent plugin ecosystem for extended functionality
- Mobile-friendly and performant
- Active community and comprehensive documentation

|----------|------|----------|
| **Render** | Free/Low-cost | Simple deployment for Spring Boot |
| **Heroku** | Free/Low-cost | Traditional PaaS option |
| **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** | Free/Low-cost | AWS ecosystem integration |
| **Google Cloud Run** | Free/Low-cost | Containerized deployment |

### Database (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)

| Platform | Type | Tier |
|----------|------|------|
| **AWS RDS** | Managed PostgreSQL | Free/Low-cost |
| **Google Cloud SQL** | Managed PostgreSQL | Free/Low-cost |
| **Azure Database** | Managed PostgreSQL | Free/Low-cost |
| **Supabase** | PostgreSQL-as-a-Service | Free/Low-cost |
| **Neon** | Serverless PostgreSQL | Free/Low-cost |
| **Render** | Managed PostgreSQL | Free/Low-cost |
